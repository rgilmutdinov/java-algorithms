Minimize k, such that condition(k) is True

The following code is the most generalized binary search template:

def binary_search(array) -> int:
    def condition(value) -> bool:
        pass

    left, right = min(search_space), max(search_space) # could be [0, n], [1, n] etc. Depends on problem
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if condition(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left
	
	
Tip. mid = (left + right + 1) / 2 Vs mid = (left + right) / 2

mid = (left + right) / 2 to find first element valid
mid = (left + right + 1) / 2 to find last element valid
